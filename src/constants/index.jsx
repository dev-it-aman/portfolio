    <>
      üë®‚Äçüíº I‚Äôm a 2023 IIT BHU graduate with ~2 years of experience building scalable, high-performance systems.
      <br /><br />
      Currently an SDE 2 at Dream11, I design, own, and optimize a distributed offers platform handling 20M+ RPM with sub-10 ms latency using Java, Vert.x, Kafka, DynamoDB, and AWS.
      <br /><br />
      Previously at OneCard, I built fintech solutions including the Core-Simulator and transaction frameworks using Java, React.js, Hibernate, PostgreSQL, JPoS, and Docker ‚Äî reducing costs and accelerating feature releases. Earlier, at Microsoft, I contributed to the Android OneNote team, adding real-time collaboration features.
      <br /><br />
      Passionate about Data Structures & Algorithms, I‚Äôve achieved Knight on LeetCode (rating 2056) and 4‚≠ê on CodeChef (rating 1940). I thrive on solving complex challenges, learning fast, and delivering impactful solutions. üîçüíªüí°
